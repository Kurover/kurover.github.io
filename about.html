		<p>
		Hello, Zan here and welcome to a simple blog (thingie) I guess.
		<br>
		Allright, let's start with the intro shall we?
		</p>
		<p>
		Let's just call me Zan, I'm here trying to start a journal about my art progress. Hopefully I can maintain or occasionally update the site. It might help me to track my lousy progress. 
		</p>
		<p>
		I'm currently drawing Manga/Anime-ish style for the moment, still practicing of course. I started back at 2013 maybe (I might be wrong). I had been doing digital drawing since then. Here's an <a href="img/home/Dsample13.jpg" onmouseover="this.src='img/home/Dsample13_P.jpg'">example</a> of my art back then, pretty average isn't it?
		</p>

		<b>â–« Hosting</b>
		<p>
		For the html, I wrote it with notepad so I can get the gist of coding. Of course I didn't magically typed all the code. I mostly looked w3school and the internet of course for tutorials. Currently the site is bare bone, I need to add things like index or comment box (using external site) in the future but these are optional, I don't need to rush adding 'em.
		</p>
		<p>
		I was interested in <a href="http://ipfs.io">ipfs.io</a> and has tried hosting with it, sadly the bandwidth usage is too big for me. Can't quite explain about IPFS, check it out for yourself!
