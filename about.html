		Hello, Zan here and welcome to a simple blog (thingie) I guess.
		<br>
		First of all, you're definitely stumbled into this site through curiousity and found the bit.ly link on my Facebook page. Yeah, knowing that, it's kinda lonely right? that's the point here yeah.
		<br>
		Allright, let's start with the intro shall we?
		</p>
		<p>
		Let's just call me Zan, I'm here trying to start a journal about my art progress. Hopefully I can maintain or occasionally update the site. It might help me to track my lousy progress. 
		</p>

		I'm currently drawing Manga/Anime-ish style for the moment, still practicing of course. I started back at 2013 maybe (I might be wrong). I had been doing digital drawing since then. Here's an <a href="img/home/Dsample13.jpg" onmouseover="this.src='img/home/Dsample13_P.jpg'">example</a> of my art back then, pretty average isn't it?

		As you might notice from your address bar, the site is suspicios asf. Don't worry, it's a hash. Specifically my hash. Not quite sure if I can explain about it but you can learn more by visiting <a href="http://ipfs.io">ipfs.io</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		For the html, I wrote it with notepad so I can get the gist of coding. Of course I didn't magically typed all the code. I mostly looked w3school and the internet of course for tutorials. Currently the site is bare bone, I need to add things like index or comment box (using external site) in the future but these are optional, I don't need to rush adding 'em.
