  <p class="no-margin">Normally we can't use the {cursor:url(image)} tag with animated '.cur' file or similar. By using animation keyframe, however, we can simulate an animated cursor with a bunch of pngs.</p>
  <p>Writing the keyframes is going to be quite long, especially if you have 24 frames or something. See CSS file for more info.</p>
