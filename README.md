# Website
A general purpose website handcrafted without JS, in spirit of pixel-art limitation of technique and presentation. Aimed to be performant, pocket-sized, and modestly styled.

:warning: Currently under development! [Old Version](https://kurover.github.io/v2) is up and running in frozen state.
