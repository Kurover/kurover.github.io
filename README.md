# Welcome
This is a portfolio website written exclusively with HTML/CSS + Jekyll. The goal is to make a simple, responsive, and performant portfolio without heavy script language. The restriction purpose is to serve as a challenge and to match the spirit of pixel-art limitation, which is my main art medium.
