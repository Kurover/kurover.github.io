# Welcome
This is a website written exclusively using HTML and CSS language with Jekyll integration. Interactive and performant is the goal. The restriction also serve as a challenge and to match the spirit of pixel-art limitations, which is my main art medium.

### :zap: Big stuff
- Main background - night scenery either on the tower foreseeing the sea or in front of the tower entrance
- Illith portrait (entrance, 2-3 idle, speaking)
- Stylla 404 error page on the sea
- Large navigation buttons, at least 96px and wide.

### :blossom: Sprite / Icon
- :leaves: Border: Navigation, Gallery, Tooltip, Button

### :snowflake: Misc Stuff (low-priority)
- Illith nag / fixed companion (bottom left). Clickable to go to top and point of interest
- 404 page where its text is a windows error popup, can be minimized, maximize is greyed out, and close to go to secret place

## To-Do list
Will continue and revise after v3 is reasonably finished
- [x] ~~Revamp website.~~
- [ ] Revamp website, again. Well more like actually finishing it..

### Implementation
- [x] ~~Art gallery page.~~
- [x] ~~Blog / project history post section.~~
- [x] ~~Contact detail page.~~
- [ ] Dedicated page and / or embedded in the real home page of a game-esque "Main Menu" screen that contain home, art sample, commission(?), and contact page; with an animated background with shop menu environment.
- [ ] Custom assets; i.e icon, border, background. 
- [ ] Dedicated commission tab / page.
- [ ] Link or preview to GroundLeaf project (pending until ready.)

### Improvement
- [x] ~~Improve Jekyll integration~~ Minimum interaction, no complex automation.
	- [x] Well, it's integrated semi-fully now.
- [x] ~~Improve container image code.~~ Technicality is much better now, can be improved further I think.
- [x] ~~Nicer links / contact view~~
- [ ] Dedicated page to test cursor in various background.
- [ ] Generalize color scheme.
- [ ] Improve zooming visual / functionality.
- [ ] Improve Table of Contents visual / readability.
- [x] ~~Rewrite .entry because that's jank.~~ No need, brain confus, also why is this list here again?
- [ ] Blog-2 UI update, maybe use the design for gallery too.
- [ ] Improve gallery navigation, nicer category selection, newest-oldest bias (instead of random ahh) etc.
