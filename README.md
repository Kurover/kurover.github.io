# Welcome
This is a portfolio website written exclusively with HTML/CSS. The goal is to make a simple, responsive, and performant (hopefully) portfolio without script language. The restriction purpose is to serve as a challenge and match the spirit of pixel-art limitation, which is my main art medium.

# To-Do list
- [x] Revamp website.
- [x] Contact detail page.
  - [ ] Pretty it up!
- [ ] Art gallery page.
- [ ] Custom assets; i.e icon, border, background.
- [ ] Link to GroundLeaf project (waiting until it's ready.)
