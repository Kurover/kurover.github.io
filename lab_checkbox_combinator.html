Essence that has been solidified can be treated as a portable natural essence bank. This isn't actually efficient as extracting the essence from the "gem" extort energy from the user. Similar on how fire burn wood to turn it into charcoal. It feels efficient to use, but the creation of it does balance out into negative.

<!--THIRD ENTRY-->
<div class="entry">
<input class="switches" type="radio" id="switchC" name="folderA">
<label class="link" for="switchC" style="color:skyblue;">This is also the Third option</label><br>
The option can be synced to other option on the second entry. Well it's just that it's the same trigger target ID. Although the CSS "checked" targetting doesn't work on multiple label, only the first child. Unless I'm missing something.
