        <p class="no-margin">Essence that has been solidified can be treated as a portable natural essence bank. This isn't actually efficient as extracting the essence from the "gem" extort energy from the user. Similar on how fire burn wood to turn it into charcoal. It feels efficient to use, but the creation of it does balance out into negative.</p>

        <p class="no-margin">Sail has soared, wind has roared. The ship has once again surf the mighty ocean in search of glory. Day by day, the wave erodes her deck.

  <!--FOURTH ENTRY-->
  <div class="wrapper">
    <h1>Interact on other container (above)</h1>
    <p><label class="btn-1 link" for="switchA" style="background-color: transparent">
      This is First option
    </label></p>
    <p><label class="btn-3 link" for="switchC" style="background-color: transparent">
      While this is the Third option
    </label></p>
    <p> `label` target seems to work even if it's outside the container. CSS "checked" targetting, however, doesn't work outside of the container nor previous object. Combinator CSS limitation pretty much.</p>
    <p> Luckily what matter the most is that the (currently hidden) "input" checkbox is written before their target. The "First" option above work because the checkbox is outside of it, while the 2nd and 3rd "input" checkbox is inside of the other entry. </p>
    <p> With that said. Put the checkbox/radio + class identifier code at outside (ex: the beginning of body) if you want to use this method to paint over multiple thing.</p>
