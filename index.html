      <p class="caption">"Sir, it's time for an upgrade"</p>
      <p>My name is Zanster, some know me as Cloverift, which is my Twitter handle. I also use Kurover in other part, wow confusing! Anyway, I'm a pixel artist who mainly draw art and animation from <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net" target="_blank">Touhou Project</a>.</p>
      <p>I'm active on
        <span class="tooltip" tabindex="0"><span>Misskey</span>
        <span class="tooltip-content"><a href="https://misskey.io/@zan@rkgk.moe" target="_blank">Misskey</a> link, remote instance <a href="https://rkgk.moe/@zan" target="_blank">rkgk.moe</a>, or search @zan@rkgk.moe -</span></span>
      and <a href="https://twitter.com/Cloverift" target="_blank">Twitter</a>! This website provides up to date, sometimes fixed, artwork that I posted there.</p>

      <p class="caption">If you see me with this picture, you are cultured.</p>
      <p>It's barebone right now as it's in a middle of a development. I started revamping it on late-November. Progress has been slow and steady.</p>
      <p>Gallery is up and function, priorities am I right? If you want to see old page, you can access it from the links on top right button, or bottom right if your screen width is under 769px (nice).</p>

      <p>Welcome keyboard user, this is the secret corner! This ain't anything special really. Just a trimmed content I still keep in the page. Kinda attached with this little place honestly.</p>
      <p>This section will be dedicated for a very trivial stuff. Like to notify you how many secrets in this website in total later and maybe other experimental pages.</p>

    <p>Under major (re)construction! You can view <a href="https://github.com/Kurover/kurover.github.io/blob/main/Version-3.md" target="_blank">V3 Notes</a> for what's being worked on and stuff.</p>
    <p>On the meantime, try looking at <a href="/gallery">Gallery</a> or check out <a href="/v2">old website</a>.</p>
