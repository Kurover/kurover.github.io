      <h2 class="no-margin-top">About: Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>Contain word and sentences that detract from the core foundation of showcase. A fluff, or perhaps a lament that is originated from the writer themself. In other word, it's a section of self-answered question(s), from yours truly.</p>
      <h2 class="no-margin-bot">About: Art History</h2>
      <p class="caption">"Once upon a time, there was an internet junky on its chair."</p>
      <p>Drawing art was once just a hobby of mine since 2013. It all started by me, innocently, scrolling through Facebook timeline and saw one of my, well, "friend of a friend", drew this amazing piece of anime art, not sure what it was but amazing nontheless. Then, it struck me, wouldn't it be cool if I also could do the thing whatever they're doing?</p>
      <p>With 1 fully finished art piece per month ratio even to this day, we jump ahead 5 revolution away toward the end of year 2017. At this time, I dipped my flimsy little toes into pixel art and it was the most fun experience I've ever had in the world of artistry. A change of pace, for a magic space.</p>
      <p>And now we are here. Trying a bit into writing, while also keeping up with the drawing. Oh, I guess HTML/CSS too, eh? Oh uh, photography and video editing? Ok, I guess I do have a fair share of problems in my hand.</p> 

      <h2 class="no-margin-bot">About: Website</h2>
      <p class="caption">"HTML5 For the win!"</p>
      <p>For all the intellectuals out there, yes, this website is exclusively powered with HTML/CSS. Sometimes, long and round-about journey are more fun than one would think of, or maybe you simply have too much time in your hands, no in-between (gosh help I could finish all these button "script" 800% faster with js.)</p>
      <p>Adding mobile view support and designing around them even for a tiny bit is hell. Respect to you front-end devs out there with this kind of job.</p>
      <p>My end goal with the website is to make a micro-pocket-sized portfolio page written with limitation (A.K.A. no script) to match the spirit of my pixel art journey! Of course, exception will be made toward raster art I'm showcasing here. </p>
      <p>I do hope that I can achieve a well interactive site where you can easily receive relevant information without getting overwhelmed by other junk floating around. Not saying I wouldn't add floating junk around, of course.</p>

      <p class="caption">Practice slash test page with codes where I might forget how it work in the future. One day I'll look into it and receive confusion damage trying to decode it, let alone looking at it.</p>
