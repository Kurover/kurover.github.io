      <h2 class="no-margin-top">About: Miscellaneous</h2>
      <p>This section contain word and sentences that detract from the core relevancy of this website existence, somewhat. It's a fluff, or perhaps a lament that is originated from the writer themself. In other word, it's a section of self-answered question(s), from yours truly.</p>
      
      <h2 class="no-margin-bot">About: UserName</h2>
      <p class="caption">"I had a lot of names, it was a terrible idea."</p>
      <p>Child and teenager me liked to use different name on online spaces. To name a couple, it's: Zanster, Zank3tsuken, Hall0wZan, TsubakiWhite, Pafu, (many other irrelevant name to my first one), and lastly, Kurover. I stopped randomly assign myself a name because it's simply not a good move if you want to gain a relevancy, which I am trying to do in world of content creator.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, Zanster and Kurover are the only one you need to remember. I tried to just forget Kurover as a whole but it has too many attachment so I can't bring myself to do it.</p>
      <p>So, where or what does the name Zanster come from? When I was a child, I loved a game called Monster Rancher 4. I remember feeling like a dead cocoon when my first monster, Garu died due to an old age. Anyway, there's a monster called 'Zan' in the game and it was cool as all heck, said me, a child. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it due to the summoning mechanic requiring you to have CD for it. Ever since then, I picked the name Zan to be my name. Probably a hard-coping mechanic for children me.</p>
      <p>With that story, just combine the word 'Zan' with 'Gangster' (because it's cool) and voila, you get Zanster! I hade to do it because the online game I played back then requires your name to have a minimum of 4 characters.</p>
      <p>As for Kurover, it come from the word Clover, which is spelled like it if you weebify it. I said weebify because the Japanese for Clover is ku-ro-ba. Clover is my second OC name that went through a lot of iteration, hence the attachment.</p>
      
      <h2 class="no-margin-bot">About: Art History</h2>
      <p class="caption">"Once upon a time, there was an internet junky on its chair."</p>
      <p>Drawing art was once just a hobby of mine since 2013. It all started by me, innocently, scrolling through Facebook timeline and saw one of my, well, "friend of a friend", drew this amazing piece of anime art, not sure what it was but amazing nontheless. Then, it struck me, wouldn't it be cool if I also could do the thing whatever they're doing?</p>
      <p>With 1 fully finished art piece per month ratio even to this day, we jump ahead 5 revolution away toward the end of year 2017. At this time, I dipped my flimsy little toes into pixel art and it was the most fun experience I've ever had in the world of artistry. A change of pace, for a magic space.</p>
      <p>And now we are here. Trying a bit into writing, while also keeping up with the drawing. Oh, I guess HTML/CSS too, eh? Oh uh, photography and video editing? Ok, I guess I do have a fair share of problems in my hand.</p> 

      <h2 class="no-margin-bot">About: Website</h2>
      <p class="caption">"HTML5 For the win!"</p>
      <p>For all the intellectuals out there, yes, this website is exclusively powered with HTML/CSS. Sometimes, long and round-about journey are more fun than one would think of, or maybe you simply have too much time in your hands, no in-between (gosh help I could finish all these button "script" 800% faster with js.)</p>
      <p>Adding mobile view support and designing around them even for a tiny bit is hell. Respect to you front-end devs out there with this kind of job.</p>
      <p>My end goal with the website is to make a micro-pocket-sized portfolio page written with limitation (A.K.A. no script) to match the spirit of my pixel art journey! Of course, exception will be made toward raster art I'm showcasing here. </p>
      <p>I do hope that I can achieve a well interactive site where you can easily receive relevant information without getting overwhelmed by other junk floating around. Not saying I wouldn't add floating junk around, of course.</p>
