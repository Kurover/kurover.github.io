		<h1>New Group Project!</h1>
		<date>30 December 16</date>
		<p>
		Well added a project tab for the progress and stuff. Anyway I joined to a RPG Game Project (?) today. Not sure who's the leader is but there's no need for one haha.

		<p>
		Well this should be interesting, for me at least. Been wanting to make 2017 to be more active and I got into this. Thank you my friend *wink.

		<h1><font color="#ff566d">Merry Christmas</font></h1>
		<date>28 December 16</date>
		<p>
		A little bit late but merry x-mas to anyone celebrating! boy it's almost the end of the year which mean I should start working on with this blog even more.
		</p>
		<p>
		This will be the first official entry for the site. <br>I reworked the entire style of site. I didn't like the previous one lol. This one is simpler and easier to edit although I need to add more stuff! I don't need to worry about having too much page... for now.
		</p>
		<P>
		I'm currently drawing Tenshi and Iku (from Touhou) with modern-ish settings (I have stalled the progress by 3 days now ugh), I plan to create some quick video process of it since my YouTube channel haven'nt been updated for 3 months now. Pretty much my priority right now and I really want to draw another piece for the new year :3
