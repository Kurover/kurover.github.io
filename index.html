    <h1>Hello!</h1>

      <p class="caption">"Sir, it's time for an upgrade"</p>
      <p>My name is Zan, also known as Kurover in some part. I'm a pixel artist who mainly draw art and animation from <a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net" target="_blank">Touhou Project</a>.</p>
      <p>I'm active on
        <span class="tooltip" tabindex="0"><span>Misskey</span>
        <span class="tooltip-content"><a href="https://misskey.io/@zan@rkgk.moe" target="_blank">Misskey</a> link or remote instance <a href="https://rkgk.moe/@zan" target="_blank">rkgk.moe</a></span></span>
      and <a href="https://twitter.com/Cloverift" target="_blank">Twitter</a>! This website provides up to date, sometimes fixed, artwork that I posted there.</p>

    <div class="profile-headshot-section" data-target="2">
      <p class="caption">If you see me with this picture, you are cultured.</p>
      <p>It's barebone right now as it's in a middle of a development. Currently it has been a week since I started revamping this site once again.</p>
      <p>Gallery is up and function, priorities am I right? If you want to see old page, you can access it from the links on top right button, or bottom right if your screen width is under 769px (nice).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="profile-headshot-section" data-target="3">
      <p>Welcome keyboard user, this is the secret corner! This ain't anything special really. Just a trimmed content I still keep in the page. Kinda attached with this little place honestly.</p>
      <p>This section will be dedicated for a very trivial stuff. Like to notify you how many secrets in this website in total later and maybe other experimental pages.</p>
