      <p>This section contain word and sentences that detract from the core relevancy of this website existence, somewhat.

      <p>One gotta start somewhere. These are handful of trivias about me. Written because I'm full of myself! Though really I just like writing these kind of fluff.</p>
      
      <h4 class="no-margin-bot quote">History of Canvas</h4>
      <details>
        <summary style="color:whitesmoke">"Once upon a time, there was an internet junky on its chair."</summary>
        <p>Drawing art was a hobby of mine since 2013. It all started by me, innocently, scrolling through Facebook timeline and saw one of my, well, "friend of a friend", drew this amazing piece of anime art, not sure what it was but amazing nonetheless. Then, it struck me, wouldn't it be cool if I also could do the thing whatever they're doing?</p>
        <p>With 1 fully finished art piece per month ratio even to this day, we jump ahead 5 revolution away toward the end of the year 2017. At this time, I dipped my flimsy little toes into pixel art and it was the most fun experience I've ever had in the graphical world. A change of pace, for a magic space.</p>
        <p>And now we are here. Trying a bit into writing, while also keeping up with the drawing. Oh, I guess HTML/CSS too, eh? Oh uh, photography and video editing? Ok, I guess I do have a fair share of problems in my hand.</p> 
      </details>
      
      <h4 class="no-margin-bot quote">Threading the Web Page</h4>
      <details>
        <summary style="color:whitesmoke">"An artist was once interested in knitting the globe."</summary>
        <p>For all you nerds out there, yes, this website is almost exclusively crafted with HTML/CSS. There's Jekyll integration here but it's mainly to restore missing links due to me renaming pages. I want to expand Jekyll automation more but that's a problem for future me.</p>
        <p>&#9830; Why bother?</p>
        <p>Why did I choose to code my own website instead of other options, you may ask? I wanted control, or really it's just cool to create one from scratch in my head. Besides, instant (and free) alternative out there doesn't sit well with me on how they plaster their branding. So making my own place is the best choice for my well-being, also it's cool.</p>
        <p>Some other reason on why I decided not to use javascript to build this website is to limit myself from going too far. I know how impulsive I am when it come to "feature-powercreep", or powercreeping my previous work in general, so the limitation is actually great.</p>
        <p>Yeah there are drawback with the current method, like, things are bit too manual for the most part. Though I'd argue it's an acquired taste, much like resource gathering in Minecraft. <span style="color: gray">Copium..</span></p>
        <p>&#9830; When? Is this your first experience?</p>
        <p>This website is technically my website 2.0. First published at 2016 and basically rewritten from zero bit at 2022. Try cloning/download <span class="center container-tooltip container-tooltip--sign"><span class="tooltip tooltip--large"><img src="img/misc/preview_old-website.png" loading="lazy"></span><a href="https://github.com/Kurover/kurover.github.io/tree/d998fb9271ac6a172f76583327eb526ac3252eae">this commit</a></span> and see the travesty it was before. It had similar structure but the purpose of it was much different. Back then it was made by little me who liked to try random cool tech, resulting in somewhat aimless direction. It also copies way too much stuff from w3schools, lol.</p>
        <p>&#9830; What's the end line here?</p>
        <p>My end goal with the website is to make a comfy portfolio on top of the "no script" limitation to match the spirit of my pixel art journey. Of course, your regular peeps wouldn't really care or know the difference, but I can share the glorious jank once in a while among the nerds. This goal has since been evolved into all-purpose website; blog, download, etc. More to come hopefully!</p>
        <p>While on it, I also hope that I can achieve an interactive website where you can easily receive relevant information without getting overwhelmed by irrelevant junk floating around. Not saying I wouldn't add floating junk around of course, hehe.</p>
        <p>Slight tangent but adding mobile view support and designing around them even for a tiny bit is hell. Respect to you front-end devs out there with this kind of job. Then again, I should create the website for mobile first and desktop later, now that I know the secret.</p>

      <h4 class="no-margin-bot quote">Nicknames Galore</h4>
      <details>
        <summary style="color:whitesmoke">"I held a lot of nameplates, it was a terrible idea."</summary>
        <p>Little me liked to use different name on online spaces. To name a couple, it's: Zanster, Zank3tsuken, Hall0wZan, Koishift, TsubakiWhite, Pafu, (many other irrelevant name to my first one), and lastly, Kurover. I stopped randomly assigning myself a name because it's simply not a good move if you want to gain a relevancy, which is what I'm trying to do in the world of content creator right now.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, Zanster and Kurover are the only one you need to remember. I tried to forget Kurover as a whole but it has a bit too much attachment and prevalence so I can't bring myself to do it.</p>
        <p>&#9830; Zanster?</p>
        <p>So, where does the name Zanster come from? Y'see, when I was a pea, I loved this game called Monster Rancher 4. There's a monster called 'Zan' in the game and it triggers all my edgy sensor. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it due to the summoning mechanic requiring you to have specific CD of it. Ever since then, I picked the name Zan to be my name. Probably a hard-coping mechanic for little me.</p>
        <p>With that story in store, combine the word 'Zan' with 'Gangster' (because it's edge +10) and voila, you get Zanster! I was forced to do it because the online game I played back then requires your name to have a minimum of 4 characters.</p>
        <p>As for Kurover, it come from the word Clover, which is spelled like it if you weebify it. I said weebify because the Japanese for Clover is ku-ro-ba. Clover is also my second OC name that went through a lot of iteration. It's the classic "overly attached on a single OC" type of deal.</p>
