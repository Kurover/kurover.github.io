    <p>Hello, this is Zan, also known as Kurover. I'm a pixel artist who mainly draw art and animation from Touhou Project.</p>
    <p>In here, I have set you up for a quick overview about the creation I've made.. once I actually built them of course.</p>
    <label class="link highlight btn-history-time" for="state-history-time">Story Time? Click me!</label>
    <div class="entry section-history-time">
      <h2>Back then,</h2>
      <p>Art was once just a hobby of mine since 2013. It all started by me, innocently, scrolling through Facebook timeline and saw one of my, well, "friend of a friend", drew this amazing piece of anime art. I wondered to myself, that it would be cool if I also could do the thing whatever they're doing.</p>
      <p>With 1 art piece per month ratio after a year of training since then, we jump 5 revolution later into the year 2017. There, I dipped my flimsy little toes into pixel art and it was the most fun experience I've ever had in the world artistry.</p>
      <p>Now we are here. Trying a bit into writing, while also keeping up with the drawing. Oh, I guess HTML/CSS too, eh? Oh uh, photography and video editing? Err.. doll making- ok I guess I do have a fair share of problems in my hand.</p>

  <div class="entry">
    <h1>&lt;div class="website"&gt;</h1>
    <p class="caption">"20kb home page, take it or leave it."</p>
    <p>This website is exclusively powered with HTML/CSS because, sometimes, long and round-about journey are more fun than one would think of. Or maybe you simply have too much time in your hands, no in-between. (gosh help I could finish these button "script" 800% faster with js)</p>
    <p>My endgoal with the website is to make a micro-pocket-sized portfolio page written with limitation (A.K.A. no script) to match the spirit of my pixel art journey! Of course, exception will be made toward raster art I'm showcasing here. </p>
    <p class="web">If you're interested behind the magic CSS button below the profile picture whatsoever, go help yourself to the lab menu, then choose the first option. Open your inspect tool and start digging!</p>
