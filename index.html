    <p>Hello, this is Zan, also known as Kurover. I'm a pixel artist who mainly draw art and animation from Touhou Project.</p>
    <p>In here, I have set you up a quick overview about the creation I've made.. once I actually construct the showcase of course.</p>

      <h2 class="no-margin">Once upon a time</h2>
      <p class="caption">"There was an internet junky on its chair."</p>
      <p>Art was once just a hobby of mine since 2013. It all started by me, innocently, scrolling through Facebook timeline and saw one of my, well, "friend of a friend", drew this amazing piece of anime art, not sure what it was but amazing nontheless. Then, it struck me, wouldn't it be cool if I also could do the thing whatever they're doing?</p>
      <p>With 1 real art piece per month ratio even to this day, we jump ahead 5 revolution away toward the end of year 2017. At this time, I dipped my flimsy little toes into pixel art and it was the most fun experience I've ever had in the world of artistry. A change of pace, for a magic space.</p>
      <p>And now we are here. Trying a bit into writing, while also keeping up with the drawing. Oh, I guess HTML/CSS too, eh? Oh uh, photography and video editing? Ok, I guess I do have a fair share of problems in my hand.</p> 
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Trivia: Web -->
  <div class="entry hidden-section about-section about-web">
    <div class="container-web">
      <h2 class="no-margin">&lt;div class= "website"&gt;</h2>
      <p class="caption">"20kb home page, take it or leave it."</p>
      <p>..at least when you exclude the sample tab. For all the intellectuals out there, yes, this website is exclusively powered with HTML/CSS. Sometimes, long and round-about journey are more fun than one would think of, or maybe you simply have too much time in your hands, no in-between (gosh help I could finish all these button "script" 800% faster with js.)</p>
      <p>Adding mobile view support and designing around them even for a tiny bit is hell. Respect to you front-end devs out there with this kind of job.</p>
      <p>My end goal with the website is to make a micro-pocket-sized portfolio page written with limitation (A.K.A. no script) to match the spirit of my pixel art journey! Of course, exception will be made toward raster art I'm showcasing here. </p>
      <p>I do hope that I can achieve a well interactive site where you can easily receive relevant information without getting overwhelmed by other junk floating around. Not saying I wouldn't add floating junk around, of course.</p>
