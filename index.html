      <p class="caption">"A wall of text, flavored of course."</p>
      <p>This section contain word and sentences that detract from the core relevancy of this website existence, somewhat. It's a fluff, mayhaps a reminder, or possibly a lament that is originated from the writer themself. In other word, it's a section of self-answered question(s), from yours truly. Y-yeah, I just wanted to embrace the flamËˆboeyan'sae in this section.</p>

      <h3>About: Me, Zanster</h3>
      <p>One way to make yourself confident is to share all about yourself. Pretentious or not, at the end of the day, we are all just here attempt to amuse our self. Wait, what were we talking about again?</p>
      
      <h4 class="no-margin-bot">History of Canvas</h4>
      <p class="caption">"Once upon a time, there was an internet junky on its chair."</p>
      <p>Drawing art was once just a hobby of mine since 2013. It all started by me, innocently, scrolling through Facebook timeline and saw one of my, well, "friend of a friend", drew this amazing piece of anime art, not sure what it was but amazing nonetheless. Then, it struck me, wouldn't it be cool if I also could do the thing whatever they're doing?</p>
      <p>With 1 fully finished art piece per month ratio even to this day, we jump ahead 5 revolution away toward the end of year 2017. At this time, I dipped my flimsy little toes into pixel art and it was the most fun experience I've ever had in the world of artistry. A change of pace, for a magic space.</p>
      <p>And now we are here. Trying a bit into writing, while also keeping up with the drawing. Oh, I guess HTML/CSS too, eh? Oh uh, photography and video editing? Ok, I guess I do have a fair share of problems in my hand.</p> 
      
      <h4 class="no-margin-bot">Threading the Web Page</h4>
      <p class="caption">"HTML5 For the win!"</p>
      <p>For all the intellectuals out there, yes, this website is exclusively powered with HTML/CSS. There's  Jekyll integration here but it's mainly to restore missing links due to me renaming pages. I want to expand Jekyll automation more but that's a problem for future me.</p>
      <p>So, why do I chose to code my own website instead of other options, you may ask? I wanted control, or really it's just cool to have in my head. Yeah there are drawback with the current method, like, things are bit too manual for the most part. Though I'd argue it's an acquired taste, much like resource gathering in Minecraft.</p>
      <p>My end goal with the website is to make a blazing fast portfolio page (because of and) written with limitation to match the spirit of my pixel art journey. This goal has since been evolved into all-purpose website; blog, download, etc. More to come hopefully!</p>
      <p>On top of that, I do hope that I can achieve a well interactive site where you can easily receive relevant information without getting overwhelmed by irrelevant junk floating around. Not saying I wouldn't add floating junk around of course, hehe.</p>
      <p>Adding mobile view support and designing around them even for a tiny bit is hell. Respect to you front-end devs out there with this kind of job. Then again, I should create the website for mobile first and desktop later, now that I know the secret.</p>
      
      <h4 class="no-margin-bot">Nicknames Galore</h4>
      <p class="caption">"I had a lot of names, it was a terrible idea."</p>
      <p>Little me liked to use different name on online spaces. To name a couple, it's: Zanster, Zank3tsuken, Hall0wZan, Koishift, TsubakiWhite, Pafu, (many other irrelevant name to my first one), and lastly, Kurover. I stopped randomly assign myself a name because it's simply not a good move if you want to gain a relevancy, which I am trying to do in world of content creator.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, Zanster and Kurover are the only one you need to remember. I tried to forget Kurover as a whole but it has a bit too much attachment and prevalence so I can't bring myself to do it.</p>
      <p>So, where does the name Zanster come from? Y'see, when I was a pea, I loved this game called Monster Rancher 4. There's a monster called 'Zan' in the game and it triggers all my edgy sensor. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it due to the summoning mechanic requiring you to have specific CD of it. Ever since then, I picked the name Zan to be my name. Probably a hard-coping mechanic for little me.</p>
      <p>With that story in store, combine the word 'Zan' with 'Gangster' (because it's edge +10) and voila, you get Zanster! I was forced to do it because the online game I played back then requires your name to have a minimum of 4 characters.</p>
      <p>As for Kurover, it come from the word Clover, which is spelled like it if you weebify it. I said weebify because the Japanese for Clover is ku-ro-ba. Clover is also my second OC name that went through a lot of iteration.</p>
